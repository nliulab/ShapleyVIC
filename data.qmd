# Data requirements

## General requirements

- Currently ShapleyVIC only applies to binary outcomes.
- Code binary outcomes as 0/1.
- No space or special characters (e.g., `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `,`) in variable 
names. Replace them using `_`.
- Variable centering/standardization is *not required*.

## Missing values and sparsity

- Handle missing entries appropriately before applying ShapleyVIC. Missing entry 
is not allowed.
- Check data distribution and handle data sparsity before applying ShapleyVIC. 
Data sparsity may increase run time and lead to unstable results.

## Additional pre-processing for high-dimensional data

- Although theoretically permissible, it is not advisable to apply ShapleyVIC 
to data with a large number of variables.
- Screen out variables with low importance (e.g., based on univariable or 
multivariable analysis p-values) to reduce dimension (e.g., to <50 variables) 
before applying ShapleyVIC.
